        in this problem you need to write a program that checks for the bigger of 3 numbers.
        you get 3 int variables: n1 , n2 and n3
        if n1 is biggest output: ""n1 is bigger""
        if n2 is biggest output: ""n2 is bigger""
        if n3 is biggest output: ""n3 is bigger""

         for example:
            n1 = 1
            n2  = 2
            n3  = 1
        output: ""n2 is bigger""
            n1 = 3
            n2  = 2
            n3  = 1
        output: ""n1 is bigger""
            n1 = 3
            n2  = 2
            n3  = 30
        output: ""n3 is bigger"""
